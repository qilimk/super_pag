"TAX000998","A","Genes annotated by the GO term GO:0008250. A multisubunit protein complex in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of eukaryotes that transfers lipid linked oligosaccharide precursor to asparagine residues on nascent proteins; includes at least nine different subunits,  at least in yeast.","10","null","Homo sapiens","MSigDB","3.47e+3"
"TAX000994","A","Genes annotated by the GO term GO:0005730. A small,  dense body one or more of which are present in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It is rich in RNA and protein,  is not bounded by a limiting membrane,  and is not seen during mitosis. Its prime function is the transcription of the nucleolar DNA into 45S ribosomal precursor RNA,  the processing of this RNA into 5.8S,  18S,  and 28S components of ribosomal RNA,  and the association of these components with 5S RNA and proteins synthesized outside the nucleolus. This association results in the formation of ribonucleoprotein precursors; these pass into the cytoplasm and mature into the 40S and 60S subunits of the ribosome.","116","null","Homo sapiens","MSigDB","1.57e+3"
"WIG000728","P","Genes involved in Biosynthesis of the N glycan precursor (dolichol lipid linked oligosaccharide,  LLO) and transfer to a nascent protein","28","null","Homo sapiens","MSigDB","1.02e+3"
"WIG000405","P","Platelet Amyloid Precursor Protein Pathway","14","null","Homo sapiens","MSigDB","948"
"TAX000621","A","Genes annotated by the GO term GO:0010468. Any process that modulates the frequency,  rate or extent of gene expression. Gene expression is the process in which a gene's coding sequence is converted into a mature gene product or products (proteins or RNA). This includes the production of an RNA transcript as well as any processing to produce a mature RNA product or an mRNA (for protein coding genes) and the translation of that mRNA into protein. Some protein processing events may be included when they are required to form an active form of a product from an inactive precursor form.","659","null","Homo sapiens","MSigDB","433"
"TAX000031","A","Genes annotated by the GO term GO:0042982. The chemical reactions and pathways involving amyloid precursor protein (APP),  the precursor of beta amyloid,  a glycoprotein associated with Alzheimer's disease.","10","null","Homo sapiens","MSigDB","336"
"TAX000316","A","Genes annotated by the GO term GO:0030098. The process whereby a relatively unspecialized precursor cell acquires specialized features of B cells,  T cells,  or natural killer cells.","26","null","Homo sapiens","MSigDB","333"
"TAX000305","A","Genes annotated by the GO term GO:0002521. The process whereby a relatively unspecialized hemopoietic precursor cell acquires the specialized features of a plasmacytoid dendritic cell or any cell of the myeloid leukocyte or lymphocyte lineages.","37","null","Homo sapiens","MSigDB","194"
"TAX000227","A","Genes annotated by the GO term GO:0006091. The chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the formation of precursor metabolites,  substances from which energy is derived,  and the processes involved in the liberation of energy from these substances.","121","null","Homo sapiens","MSigDB","190"
"TAX000364","A","Genes annotated by the GO term GO:0030099. The process whereby a relatively unspecialized myeloid precursor cell acquires the specialized features of any cell of the myeloid leukocyte,  megakaryocyte,  thrombocyte,  or erythrocyte lineages.","36","null","Homo sapiens","MSigDB","51.6"
"TAX000365","A","Genes annotated by the GO term GO:0002573. The process whereby a relatively unspecialized myeloid precursor cell acquires the specialized features of any cell of the myeloid leukocyte lineage.","14","null","Homo sapiens","MSigDB","28.0"
