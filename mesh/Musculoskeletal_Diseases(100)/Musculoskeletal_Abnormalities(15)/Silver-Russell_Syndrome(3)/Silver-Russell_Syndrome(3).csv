"TAX000794","A","Genes annotated by the GO term GO:0000041. The directed movement of transition metal ions into,  out of,  within or between cells. A transition metal is an element whose atom has an incomplete d subshell of extranuclear electrons,  or which gives rise to a cation or cations with an incomplete d subshell. Transition metals often have more than one valency state. Biologically relevant transition metals include vanadium,  manganese,  iron,  copper,  cobalt,  nickel,  molybdenum and silver.","12","null","Homo sapiens","MSigDB","430"

Interacting selectively with a transition metal ions; a transition metal is an element whose atom has an incomplete d subshell of extranuclear electrons,  or which gives rise to a cation or cations with an incomplete d subshell. Transition metals often have more than one valency state.
