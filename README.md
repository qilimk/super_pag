# The algorithms for partitioning a weighted graph
1. BSF(Breadth-First-Search)
The well-known **BFS (Breadth-First-Search)** algorithm can also be used for graph partitioning. BFS algorithm traverses the graph level by level and marks each vertex with the level in which it was visited. After completion of the traversal, the set of vertices of the graph is portioned into two parts `V1` and `V2` by putting all vertices with level less than or equal to a pre-determined threshold `L` in the set `V1` and putting the remaining vertices (with level greater than `L`) in the set `V2`. `L` is so chosen that `|V1|` is close to `|V2|`.

2. Kernighan-Lin Algorithm
The **Kernighan-Lin algorithm** (KL algorithm hereafter) is one of the oldest heuristic graph partitioning algorithms proposed in 1970 [6]. In the simplest possible setting, the KL algorithm takes an edge-weighted graph `G = (V, E, edge-weight function c)` with `2n` vertices and an initial bi-partition `(V1, V2)` of the vertex set `V` where `|V1| = |V2| = n` and produces a new partition `(V1’, V2’)` such that `|V1’| = |V2’| = n` and the total cost of the new partition is lower than (or equal to) the cost of the original partition.

Note that the KL algorithm is a balanced partitioning algorithm, i.e., the two parts produced by the KL algorithm have the same (or almost the same, in a more general setting) number of vertices. It iteratively swaps pairs of vertices until it reaches a locally optimal partition and runs in time `O(N^3)` where `N` is the number of vertices in `G` (for example, `N = 2n` when we assume that we started with a graph with `2n` vertices).

3. Fiduccia-Mattheyses Algorithm

The **Fiduccia-Mattheyses algorithm** (FM algorithm hereafter) is a significant advancement in the field of graph partitioning, introduced by C.M. Fiduccia and R.M. Mattheyses in 1982. This algorithm is an improvement over the Kernighan-Lin algorithm and is specifically designed for partitioning large-scale VLSI circuits.

The FM algorithm operates on an edge-weighted graph `G = (V, E, edge-weight function c)` and aims to optimize the partitioning of the graph's vertices into two subsets, `V1` and `V2`, while maintaining a balance between the sizes of these subsets. Unlike the Kernighan-Lin algorithm, which swaps pairs of vertices between partitions, the FM algorithm moves individual vertices across the partition boundary. This approach allows for more granular adjustments, often leading to better optimization in fewer iterations.

A key feature of the FM algorithm is its use of a data structure called a **gain bucket**, which efficiently identifies the vertices whose movement would most decrease the cut size (i.e., the number of edges crossing the partition boundary). The algorithm iteratively moves the vertex with the highest gain from one partition to the other, updating the gains of adjacent vertices as it proceeds.

The FM algorithm is particularly noted for its computational efficiency, scaling well with the size of the graph, and is widely used in electronic design automation (EDA). It typically runs in time `O(E + V)`, where `E` is the number of edges and `V` is the number of vertices in the graph.

4. Spectral Bisection Algorithm

The **Spectral Bisection Algorithm** is a method used in graph partitioning, which utilizes the spectral properties of graphs to find an optimal bisection. This algorithm is particularly effective for partitioning sparse graphs and is widely used in various applications, including parallel computing, VLSI design, and network analysis.

The Spectral Bisection Algorithm operates based on the following steps:

4.1 **Laplacian Matrix**: It begins by constructing the Laplacian matrix `L` of the graph `G`. The Laplacian matrix is defined as `L = D - A`, where `D` is the degree matrix and `A` is the adjacency matrix of the graph.

4.2 **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: The algorithm then computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix. The second smallest eigenvalue (known as the Fiedler value) and its corresponding eigenvector (the Fiedler vector) are of particular interest.

4.3 **Partitioning**: The graph is partitioned into two sets based on the sign of the components of the Fiedler vector. Nodes corresponding to positive components of the Fiedler vector are placed in one set, and those corresponding to negative components are placed in the other set.
